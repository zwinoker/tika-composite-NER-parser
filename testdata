3. With a pen or pencil, trace on the paper the path of the light and the position of the mirror.
4. Repeat the process for incident angles of 50o and 80o. You should use separate regions of the paper such that the light ray traces to not overlap.
5. With a protractor, measure and record values for the angle of incidence and reflection. Calculate the percentage error between these values.
6. Do your results vary significantly between the large and small angles?
4.2 Curved Mirrors
1. Place a new piece of paper (or the back side of the existing sheet) under the RayBox and position the RayBox such that a single light ray is emitted.
2. Place the concave mirror in the path of the light ray and trace the position of the mirror and the light ray.
3. Repeat Step 2 with the convex mirror.
4. With a protractor, measure and record values for the angles of incidence and reflection. Calculate the percentage error between these values. Make sure to describe how you measure an angle from a curved surface.
4.3 Mirror Images
1. Position the RayBox such that 5 light rays are emitted. Adjust the box so the rays are parallel.
2. Place the Concave mirror in the path of the rays such that the rays reflect and converge. Determine the focal length and radius of curvature of the mirror (EQ 2 and EQ 3). You will need to trace the rays and the mirror surface on paper so that you can measure it with a ruler. Record your values in your lab notebook.
3. Place the Convex mirror in the path of the light rays. Since these rays diverge, you will need to extend their path behind the mirror surface after tracing. Find the focal length and radius of curvature for this mirror and record it in your lab notebook.
4. Do these mirrors provide a perfect focus (all 5 rays coincide at a single point)? Why?
5. When mirrors are used off-axis (i.e. the incident light is not parallel to the optical axis of the mirror) they will usually cause some aberration in the image. Investigate this statement and determine at what angle (if any) the

4.4 Snell’s Law
1. With the RayBox still adjusted to emit 1 light ray, place the semi-circular glass cell in the light path such that the light enters the cell perpendicular to the flat surface. Move the cell around and watch the effect on the single light ray. You may notice some of the light reflected from the first surface of the cell while other light is transmitted into the cell.
2. Adjust the glass cell such that the single ray enters perpendicular to the flat surface, but does not travel straight through the center of the cell.

3. Trace the surface of the cell and the light path. From this trace, measure the angles of incidence and refraction from the second surface. Remember, these angles are measured from a hypothetical line which is perpendicular to the surface of the cell. This hypothetical line is a tangent to the surface and can found by drawing a line
perpendicular (90o) to a radius of the circle.
4. Using Snell’s Law (EQ 1), calculate the index of refraction of the cell material. Based on Table 1, can you
